# Processing (p5.js) sketchpad

Currently contains one sketch, a reverse engineered version of this artwork: [link](https://x.com/dailyminimal/status/1423693725407064070?s=20) attributed to @SHAPE_THERAPY [twitter](https://twitter.com/shape_therapy), evidently titled FP-A-002 FALSE PERCEPTIONS; though the art is not currently found on their page. 


Code derived (with heavy modification) from another attempt at reverse-engineering by Vuenc [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/1ac47v2/comment/kjsrmsq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
