# Processing (p5.js) sketchpad

Currently contains one sketch, a reverse engineered version of the image shared here: [link]{https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/1ac47v2/helpi_want_to_create_a_similar_effect/} (Will credit original artist if I learn who they are...)
Code derived (with heavy modification) from another attempt at reverse-engineering by Vuenc [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/1ac47v2/comment/kjsrmsq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
